# Welcome to Dub Diary!!!

Dub Diary is a solo personal project I made out of a need for my own hype man. It's a small diary dedicated to documenting your own wins or 'dubs'. Pretty straightforward really. You enter a dub, then click the "hype me up" button to receive a piece of encouragement. Each dub is saved to a local db and there's NO delete, so it requires some thoughtfulness, like writing with ink. 

Thanks for reading!
